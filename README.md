    GeoAssistant AI is designed to help users that have little to no experience become better in the game of GeoGuessr. The extension is powered by a back-end AI model on a separate server, which is used to detect certain distinct patterns such as bollards, cars, traffic signs, language, etc. The idea is to highlight such patterns on a user's screen with a brief description of what it is and in what country it can be seen. This approach can teach users tricks on how to become better GeoGuessr players in an interactive manner without using any additional resources.

This extension is designed to be used only for educational purposes, thus, to align with GeoGuessr rules and competitiveness, we have disabled the extension in multiplayer, both ranked and unranked, as well as in custom parties.
